Flooding is the most costly natural disaster in Australia, causing more damage on average than bushfires, storms, and cyclones combined. In Victoria, thousands of properties sit within officially mapped flood zones — and many owners and buyers don't know until it's too late. Whether you're buying a property, building on one, or just want to understand your risk, here's how to check.

## Victoria's Flood Overlays Explained

The Victorian Planning Scheme uses three main overlays to identify flood-affected land. Understanding the differences is important because they carry different levels of restriction and risk.

| Overlay | Code | What It Means |
|---------|------|---------------|
| **Land Subject to Inundation Overlay** | LSIO | Identifies land affected by the 1-in-100-year flood (1% AEP). The main flood overlay. You'll need a planning permit for most new buildings, extensions, and even some fences. Floor levels must be set above the designated flood level. |
| **Floodway Overlay** | FO | Identifies land carrying the greatest volume and velocity of floodwater. More restrictive than LSIO. Development is heavily restricted because buildings in the floodway redirect water onto neighbours and put lives at risk. Some FO land is effectively undevelopable. |
| **Special Building Overlay** | SBO | Identifies urban land prone to overland flooding from stormwater drainage, not riverine flooding. Common in older suburbs where drainage was designed for lower rainfall intensity. Less severe than LSIO/FO but still triggers permit requirements. |

💡 **Key difference:** The LSIO and FO relate to riverine flooding (rivers and creeks overflowing). The SBO relates to overland flow flooding (stormwater overwhelming drains). A property can be affected by one, multiple, or none of these.

## How to Check Your Property's Flood Status

### Option 1: NestCheck (free, instant)

[Search any Victorian address on NestCheck](https://nestcheck.com.au) and your free report will show whether the property falls within any flood overlay, proximity to mapped flood-prone areas, and an overall climate risk score factoring flood alongside bushfire, storm, and other hazards.

### Option 2: VicPlan (government portal)

The Victorian Government's [VicPlan](https://mapshare.vic.gov.au/vicplan/) tool lets you search any address and toggle planning overlays on or off. Look for the LSIO (light blue), FO (darker blue), and SBO (hatched blue). The interface takes getting used to, but it's the authoritative government source.

### Option 3: Melbourne Water

[Melbourne Water](https://www.melbournewater.com.au) maintains flood maps for metropolitan Melbourne. You can request a Property Information Statement confirming whether your property is affected by flooding and the designated flood level — essential if you're planning to build.

### Option 4: Local council

Your local council's planning department can confirm overlay status and advise on permit requirements. For regional Victoria, the relevant Catchment Management Authority (CMA) is the flood authority.

## How Flood Zones Affect You

### Insurance costs

Properties in mapped flood zones face significantly higher insurance premiums — often $1,000 to $5,000+ more per year than equivalent properties outside flood zones. After the 2022 Victorian floods, some insurers pulled out of high-risk postcodes entirely or imposed $10,000-$20,000 excesses on flood claims. Before buying, get an insurance quote for the specific property. An extra $2,000/year over a 30-year mortgage is $60,000 in additional cost.

### Building and renovations

Properties in the LSIO or FO need a planning permit for most development, including extensions, sheds, and some fencing. The referral authority sets conditions including minimum floor levels and flood-resilient construction materials. Raising floor levels alone can add $10,000-$30,000+ to a build, and flood-resilient materials add further expense.

### Property value

Properties in flood overlays typically sell at a 3-10% discount compared to equivalent properties outside flood zones. This discount has been widening as buyers become more climate-aware and insurance costs rise. The discount is sharpest immediately after a major flood event.

🌊 **Climate change is expanding flood zones.** Rainfall patterns are changing. Properties just outside the 1-in-100-year flood line a decade ago may now be within it. Check when your area's flood mapping was last updated — some studies are over 20 years old.

## What If the Property Has Flooded Before?

The vendor's Section 32 statement must disclose planning overlays (LSIO, FO, SBO) but doesn't always require disclosure of past flood events that didn't result in insurance claims. To investigate further: ask the selling agent directly, check with council for flood-related complaints or building orders, search council meeting minutes for flood discussions in the area, and during inspection look for watermarks, musty subfloor smells, and recently replaced lower wall linings or flooring.

## Reducing Flood Risk on Your Property

If you own in a flood-prone area, practical measures can reduce risk and potentially lower insurance premiums: install a sump pump, keep drains and gutters clear (blocked stormwater drains are the number one cause of urban flash flooding), raise electrical outlets and switchboards above flood level, use flood-resistant materials below flood level (concrete, tiles, marine-grade timber rather than carpet and plasterboard), and have a flood emergency plan — the Bureau of Meteorology's flood warning service covers all major Victorian waterways.
