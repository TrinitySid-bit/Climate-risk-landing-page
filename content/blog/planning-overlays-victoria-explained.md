Every property in Victoria has a planning zone (like General Residential or Commercial) that determines what you can broadly do with it. But many properties also have one or more **planning overlays** — additional layers of controls that add extra requirements or restrictions on top of the base zone. Overlays can affect what you build, how you build it, what you demolish, and even what trees you remove. Here's what each one means in plain English.

## How Overlays Work

Think of the zone as the main rules for the property, and overlays as bonus conditions stacked on top. A property in the General Residential Zone might also have a Heritage Overlay (restricting demolition and alterations), an Environmental Significance Overlay (protecting vegetation), and a Land Subject to Inundation Overlay (requiring flood-resistant construction). Each overlay adds its own set of permit triggers and conditions.

You can check what overlays apply to any Victorian property through [NestCheck](https://nestcheck.com.au) (free instant report), [VicPlan](https://mapshare.vic.gov.au/vicplan/) (government mapping tool), or your local council's planning department.

## Heritage and Character Overlays

### Heritage Overlay (HO)
**Code:** HO | **Impact:** High

Protects places of heritage significance — individual buildings or entire precincts. If your property has an HO, you'll likely need a planning permit to demolish, alter the exterior, build additions, or even paint the facade a different colour. Internal alterations are usually exempt unless the property is individually listed on the Heritage Register. Heritage overlays can increase property value by protecting the character of a neighbourhood, but they significantly limit what you can do to the building. Renovations must be sympathetic to the heritage character, which often means higher-cost materials and specialist trades.

### Neighbourhood Character Overlay (NCO)
**Code:** NCO | **Impact:** Medium

Aims to protect the existing character of an area without full heritage restrictions. Commonly applied in leafy suburbs with consistent architectural styles. The NCO typically affects setbacks, building height, site coverage, and vegetation retention. It's less restrictive than the Heritage Overlay but still limits the scale and style of new development. If you're planning to demolish and rebuild, the NCO means your new design needs to be sympathetic to what's already on the street.

## Environmental Overlays

### Environmental Significance Overlay (ESO)
**Code:** ESO | **Impact:** Medium

Protects areas of environmental significance — native vegetation, waterways, habitats. If your property has an ESO, you'll typically need a permit to remove or lop native vegetation, build structures within setback distances from waterways, or disturb significant habitats. The ESO doesn't stop development but adds conditions. Expect a requirement for a vegetation assessment and potentially an offset if trees are removed — offsets can cost $5,000-$50,000+ depending on the significance of the vegetation.

### Vegetation Protection Overlay (VPO)
**Code:** VPO | **Impact:** Medium

Specifically protects significant trees and vegetation. Unlike the ESO which covers broader environmental values, the VPO is focused on trees — you'll need a permit to remove, destroy, or lop vegetation above certain thresholds (often any tree with a trunk diameter over 50cm). Very common in Melbourne's green-belt suburbs like Eltham, Warrandyte, and the Dandenong Ranges. Can affect where you position a house extension or new driveway.

### Significant Landscape Overlay (SLO)
**Code:** SLO | **Impact:** Low-Medium

Protects the visual character of a landscape — ridgelines, coastal areas, valleys. The SLO typically affects building height, materials, colours, and setbacks to ensure development doesn't dominate the landscape. Common along the Great Ocean Road, in the Yarra Ranges, and on the Mornington Peninsula.

## Hazard Overlays

### Bushfire Management Overlay (BMO)
**Code:** BMO | **Impact:** High

Identifies land at risk of bushfire. Properties in the BMO must comply with bushfire construction standards (AS 3959), which adds significant cost to building and renovation — from $20,000 to $80,000+ depending on the BAL rating. Insurance premiums are also substantially higher. For a deep dive, see our [guide to checking bushfire risk in Victoria](https://nestcheck.com.au/blog/bushfire-risk-check-victoria).

### Land Subject to Inundation Overlay (LSIO)
**Code:** LSIO | **Impact:** High

Identifies land affected by the 1-in-100-year flood. Requires planning permits for most development, minimum floor levels above the designated flood level, and flood-resilient construction. Insurance costs are significantly higher. See our [flood zone guide](https://nestcheck.com.au/blog/flood-zone-check-victoria) for full details.

### Floodway Overlay (FO)
**Code:** FO | **Impact:** High

The most restrictive flood overlay — identifies land carrying the greatest volume and velocity of floodwater. Development is heavily restricted and in many cases effectively prohibited. Properties in the FO can be very difficult to insure.

### Erosion Management Overlay (EMO)
**Code:** EMO | **Impact:** Medium

Identifies land prone to erosion, landslip, or instability. Common on steep slopes and coastal areas. Triggers requirements for geotechnical assessment before building and restrictions on earthworks and vegetation removal that could destabilise the land.

## Design and Development Overlays

### Design and Development Overlay (DDO)
**Code:** DDO | **Impact:** Medium

Sets specific design requirements for an area — maximum building height, setbacks, building materials, roof pitch, facade articulation, and more. Each DDO schedule is different and tailored to the local area. Common in activity centres, around train stations, and in areas undergoing urban renewal. The DDO is often used to manage the transition between higher-density development and surrounding residential areas.

### Development Plan Overlay (DPO)
**Code:** DPO | **Impact:** Low-Medium

Requires a development plan to be approved before development can proceed. Usually applied to large sites earmarked for comprehensive development — former industrial land, greenfield estates, and major redevelopment sites. If you're buying a house in an existing residential area, a DPO is unlikely to affect you directly, but it might tell you that a nearby site is planned for development.

💡 **Multiple overlays are common.** It's not unusual for a property to have 3-5 overlays stacked on top of each other. A property in the Dandenong Ranges might have a BMO (bushfire), ESO (environmental), VPO (vegetation), SLO (landscape), and NCO (character) — all at once. Each one adds its own layer of permit requirements.

## How Overlays Affect Property Value

The value impact depends entirely on which overlay and what the buyer wants to do. Heritage overlays in desirable suburbs often **increase** value because they protect the character of the streetscape and prevent neighbouring properties from being overdeveloped. Bushfire and flood overlays almost always **decrease** value due to higher insurance and construction costs. Environmental overlays can go either way — some buyers see tree protection as preserving the area's appeal, while developers see it as a constraint on yield.

If you're buying with plans to renovate or extend, the overlays are arguably more important than the zone. A property in the General Residential Zone with a Heritage Overlay and an Environmental Significance Overlay is far more constrained than one in the same zone with no overlays. Always check before you buy — and definitely before you get renovation quotes.
