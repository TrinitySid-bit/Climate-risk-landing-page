    <p>A tradie quote arrives and it looks like a foreign language. "Call-out fee." "Labour — 4.5hrs @ $120." "Sundries & consumables." "Provisional sum." What does it all mean, and how do you know if it's reasonable? This guide breaks down every common line item you'll see on an Australian trade quote so you can read one with confidence.</p>

    <h2>The Anatomy of a Trade Quote</h2>

    <p>A well-structured trade quote should include the tradie's business details (name, ABN, licence number, contact info), a description of the work, an itemised list of charges, payment terms, and a validity period. If any of these are missing, that's worth noting — we cover the warning signs in our guide to <a href="https://tradietruth.com.au/blog/red-flags-in-tradie-quotes">red flags in tradie quotes</a>.</p>

    <p>Let's go through each line item type you're likely to encounter.</p>

    <div class="line-item-box">
        <h3>Call-Out Fee / Site Inspection Fee</h3>
        <div class="typical">Typical: $60 – $120</div>
        <p>This covers the tradie's travel time to your property and their initial assessment of the job. Think of it as the price of getting a professional opinion on-site. Many tradies waive this fee if you proceed with the work. Some charge it regardless. Both approaches are standard — just confirm before they visit which applies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line-item-box">
        <h3>Labour</h3>
        <div class="typical">Typical: $50 – $200/hr depending on trade</div>
        <p>The biggest chunk of most quotes. Labour should show either an hourly rate multiplied by the estimated hours, or a fixed labour charge for the entire job. Plumbers and electricians sit at the higher end ($80-200/hr) because they're licensed trades requiring years of apprenticeship. Painters and general handymen typically charge less ($40-90/hr). If the quote shows a lump-sum labour figure without hours or rate, ask for the breakdown.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line-item-box">
        <h3>Materials / Parts (Supplied)</h3>
        <div class="typical">Varies — check retail price + 10-30% markup</div>
        <p>Any physical materials the tradie provides for the job: pipes, fittings, fixtures, timber, wiring, tiles, adhesives, and so on. Each major item should be listed separately. A reasonable markup on materials is 10-30% above retail — this covers the tradie's time sourcing, transporting, and warranting the products. If a specific brand and model is listed, you can verify the retail price with a quick Google search.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line-item-box">
        <h3>Sundries / Consumables</h3>
        <div class="typical">Typical: $20 – $50</div>
        <p>Small items that are used up during the job: screws, nails, cable ties, sealant, tape, sandpaper, drill bits. These are normal and expected. The issue is when sundries balloon past $50-100 without explanation. At that point, ask for an itemised list. If the tradie can't tell you specifically what's in the sundries line, it's likely padding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line-item-box">
        <h3>Waste Removal / Disposal</h3>
        <div class="typical">Typical: $50 – $200</div>
        <p>If the job involves removing old materials — a demolished bathroom, an old hot water system, stripped wiring — the tradie needs to dispose of it. This is a legitimate charge. For small jobs (a single appliance), expect $50-100. For larger demolition work, $150-300 is normal. Make sure disposal is actually included in the quote and not assumed to be your problem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line-item-box">
        <h3>Provisional Sum / Allowance</h3>
        <div class="typical">Varies — acts as a placeholder</div>
        <p>A provisional sum is an estimate for work that can't be precisely costed until the job is underway. For example, "provisional sum for concealed plumbing — $500" means the tradie expects it'll cost around $500 but won't know for sure until they open the wall. This is common and honest, but make sure you agree on how variations will be handled if the actual cost exceeds the estimate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line-item-box">
        <h3>GST (10%)</h3>
        <div class="typical">10% of total</div>
        <p>If the tradie is registered for GST (compulsory for businesses earning over $75,000/year), 10% GST applies to the total. Always confirm whether the quoted price is GST-inclusive or GST-exclusive. A $2,000 quote that's "plus GST" is actually $2,200. This is a common source of misunderstanding.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Fixed Price vs. Hourly Rate — Which Is Better?</h2>

    <p>There's no single right answer, but each approach has trade-offs. A <strong>fixed-price quote</strong> gives you certainty — you know exactly what you'll pay. The tradie carries the risk if the job takes longer. An <strong>hourly rate quote</strong> is often cheaper for simple, predictable jobs but can blow out if complications arise. For most homeowners, a fixed price with a clear scope of work is the safer option. Just make sure the scope is detailed enough that there's no ambiguity about what's included.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p>💡 <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If a tradie quotes hourly, ask for a "not to exceed" figure — a maximum cap. This gives you the benefit of hourly pricing (potentially lower cost) with a ceiling that protects you from blowouts.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What Should a Quote NOT Include?</h2>

    <p>Watch out for charges that shouldn't be on a standard quote: "administration fees" or "office processing" charges ($30-80 added for paperwork), travel surcharges beyond the standard call-out fee (unless you're in a genuinely remote area), "tool wear" or "equipment hire" charges for standard tools the tradie should already own, and charges for "cleanup" that should be part of any professional job. These aren't universally dodgy, but they're worth questioning when they appear.</p>

    <h2>Getting a Second Opinion — The Smart Way</h2>

    <p>Getting three quotes is the traditional advice, and it's still good advice for large jobs. But for smaller jobs, the time spent organising three site visits can be more hassle than it's worth. What you really need is a way to quickly check whether the single quote you've got is in the right ballpark.</p>
