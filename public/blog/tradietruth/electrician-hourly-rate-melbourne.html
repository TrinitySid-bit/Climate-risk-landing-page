    <h1>Electrician Hourly Rate Melbourne 2026: What's Fair?</h1>

<article class="blog-content">

    <p>Electrical work is one of those trades where you absolutely need a licensed professional — it's illegal to do your own electrical work in Australia, and for good reason. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't understand what fair pricing looks like. Whether you're getting downlights installed, a switchboard upgraded, or your whole house rewired, here's what electricians in Melbourne are charging in 2026.</p>

    <h2>Standard Electrician Hourly Rates in Melbourne</h2>

    <table class="price-table">
        <thead>
            <tr><th>Time of Service</th><th>Typical Hourly Rate</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>Standard hours (Mon-Fri, 7am-5pm)</td><td>$80 – $150/hr</td></tr>
            <tr><td>After hours (evenings, Sat)</td><td>$120 – $200/hr</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Emergency / Sunday / Public Holiday</td><td>$150 – $280/hr</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Most Melbourne electricians charge in the $90-130/hr range during business hours. If you're seeing quotes at $150/hr for standard daytime work, it's at the top end but not necessarily unfair — some specialists (like those doing solar installations or EV charger work) command premium rates due to additional certifications.</p>

    <p>The call-out fee is typically $80 to $120 on top of the hourly rate and covers travel time to your property. Some electricians include the first 30 minutes of work in the call-out fee, so always ask what's included.</p>

            <tr><td>Ceiling fan installation</td><td>$200 – $450</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Switchboard upgrade</td><td>$1,200 – $3,000</td></tr>

    </table>

    <h2>Why Electrical Quotes Vary So Much</h2>

    <p>You might get three quotes for the same job and see a $1,000 spread between them. That doesn't necessarily mean anyone's ripping you off. Electrical pricing varies based on several factors.</p>

    <h3>Access and complexity</h3>
    <p>Running cable through a single-storey brick veneer with accessible roof space is straightforward. Running cable through a double-brick two-storey with no roof access requires cutting into walls, patching, and potentially repainting. The labour time can be 3-5x longer for the same end result.</p>

    <h3>Switchboard capacity</h3>
    <p>If your switchboard is full or outdated, adding new circuits might require an upgrade first. A switchboard upgrade alone runs $1,200-3,000, and it'll be listed as a separate line item on your quote. If you're getting 10 downlights installed and the quote includes a switchboard upgrade, the total will look high — but it might be genuinely necessary.</p>

    <h3>Compliance upgrades</h3>
    <p>Older homes often don't meet current electrical standards. If the electrician discovers issues during the job — no safety switch, non-compliant wiring, missing earth connections — they're legally required to address them. This can add cost that wasn't in the original scope. A good electrician will flag this risk upfront rather than surprising you mid-job.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <p>💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> When comparing electrical quotes, check whether each one includes the same scope. A cheaper quote might exclude the switchboard work or compliance upgrades that the more expensive quote has factored in. Like for like matters.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Downlights — The Most Common Electrical Quote</h2>

    <p>Downlight installation is one of the most frequently quoted electrical jobs in Melbourne, so it's worth breaking down specifically. The cost per downlight depends heavily on quantity — because most of the electrician's time is in setup, running cables, and cutting holes. The actual wiring of each additional light is relatively quick.</p>

    <p>For a single downlight retrofit (replacing an existing fitting), expect $60-120. For a new downlight installation requiring new cabling, $100-180 per light is typical. For 10+ downlights as part of a renovation, the per-light cost often drops to $50-80 because the fixed setup cost is spread across more units.</p>

    <p>If your quote shows 10 downlights at $150 each ($1,500), that's at the top end for a bulk install. But if it includes new circuits and a dimmer switch, it might be reasonable. Context matters — and that's why reading the line items is important.

    <h2>Questions to Ask Your Electrician</h2>

    <p><strong>"Does my switchboard have capacity for this job, or will it need upgrading?"</strong> — This is the single biggest variable in electrical quotes. Ask upfront so there are no surprises.</p>

    <p><strong>"Are there likely compliance issues with my existing wiring?"</strong> — In older Melbourne homes (pre-2000), the answer is often yes. Better to know before the job starts.</p>

    <p><strong>"Is the quote fixed price or will it vary based on what you find?"</strong> — For predictable jobs (like downlights in a new home), fixed price is reasonable. For older homes where hidden issues are likely, an estimate with a "not to exceed" cap protects both sides.</p>

    <p><strong>"What certificate of compliance will I get?"</strong> — All notifiable electrical work in Victoria requires a Certificate of Electrical Safety. If your electrician doesn't mention this, ask why.</p>
