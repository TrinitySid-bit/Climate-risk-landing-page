<article class="blog-content">

    <p>Safety is one of the first things people consider when choosing where to live. But "is this suburb safe?" is a deceptively complex question. Crime statistics tell part of the story, but they need context to be useful. Here's how to check crime rates for any Victorian suburb, what the numbers actually mean, and where the data comes from.</p>

    <h2>Where Does Victorian Crime Data Come From?</h2>

    <p>Victoria's crime statistics are published by the <strong>Crime Statistics Agency (CSA)</strong>, an independent body that analyses data recorded by Victoria Police. The data is released quarterly and broken down by Local Government Area (LGA), postcode, and offence type. This is the same data that NestCheck uses to generate crime scores in our property reports.</p>

    <p>You can access the raw data at <a href="https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au" rel="nofollow">crimestatistics.vic.gov.au</a>, though the interface requires multiple filters and spreadsheet downloads. For a quicker view, <a href="https://nestcheck.com.au">NestCheck</a> pulls this data automatically for any address and presents it in plain English with a risk score.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Crime Categories</h2>

    <p>Not all crime is equal when it comes to personal safety. The CSA breaks Victorian crime into several major categories, and understanding each helps you interpret the statistics accurately.</p>

    <table class="price-table">
        <thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Includes</th><th>What It Means for You</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Crimes against the person</strong></td><td>Assault, robbery, sexual offences, homicide, stalking</td><td>Most directly relevant to personal safety. High rates here are the biggest concern.</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Property crime</strong></td><td>Burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, property damage</td><td>Affects your home and belongings. Consider home security and insurance.</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Drug offences</strong></td><td>Drug use, possession, trafficking</td><td>Often inflated in areas with more police activity. Doesn't always mean less safety.</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Public order</strong></td><td>Weapons offences, disorderly conduct, liquor offences</td><td>Higher near nightlife precincts. Doesn't always reflect residential safety.</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Justice procedures</strong></td><td>Bail breaches, resist arrest</td><td>Reflects police activity, not community safety.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout">
        <p>💡 <strong>Key insight:</strong> A suburb with high total crime numbers might actually be very safe to live in if the majority of offences are drug possession or public order incidents concentrated in a commercial strip. Always look at the breakdown, not just the headline number.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Floor Factor: Why Apartments Are Different</h2>

    <p>If you're buying an apartment, suburb-level crime statistics need additional context. Property crimes like burglary are significantly less likely for higher-floor units — a ground-floor apartment is far more vulnerable than a 15th-floor unit in the same building. NestCheck's premium reports factor in floor level when scoring crime risk for apartments.</p>

    <p>Similarly, apartments with secure lobby access, CCTV, and on-site management experience far lower property crime than their suburb averages suggest. The suburb data is a useful baseline, but building characteristics matter enormously for apartment buyers.</p>

    <h2>Crime Rate vs. Crime Count: Why Per-Capita Matters</h2>

    <p>Melbourne CBD has some of the highest crime counts in Victoria. Does that mean it's the most dangerous place to live? Not necessarily. The CBD has a tiny residential population but a massive daytime population of workers, tourists, and visitors. Dividing the crime count by the residential population gives a wildly inflated per-capita rate that doesn't reflect actual risk to residents.</p>

    <p>The same applies to suburbs with major shopping centres, train stations, hospitals, or entertainment precincts. These attract people from outside the suburb, inflating the crime count without necessarily making residential streets less safe. When checking statistics, always consider what's drawing people into the area beyond residents.</p>

    <h2>What the Data Can't Tell You</h2>

    <p>Crime statistics only reflect <strong>reported</strong> crime — actual incidence of some offences (particularly family violence and sexual assault) is significantly higher than recorded. Reporting rates vary by suburb and demographic. The data is also retrospective — it tells you what happened in the past, which may not predict the future in rapidly gentrifying areas where crime trends can shift within a few years.</p>

    <p>Statistics also miss the <strong>feel</strong> of a suburb. Street lighting, pedestrian activity, building maintenance, community engagement — these affect perceived safety and actual risk in ways that don't appear in police data. If possible, visit a suburb at night before committing to buy.</p>

    <h2>How NestCheck Scores Crime Risk</h2>

    <p>Rather than dumping raw statistics, NestCheck processes CSA data through a severity-weighted scoring system. Not all crimes contribute equally: an assault carries more weight than a shoplifting incident. We also adjust for property type — higher-floor apartments face lower burglary risk. The result is a crime risk score from 1 to 10 that gives you a quick read on how the area compares to the Victorian average.</p>

    <p>Our premium reports break down crime by categories relevant to residential safety: burglary, car theft, assault, robbery, and criminal damage — the offences that most directly affect homeowners and renters.</p>
